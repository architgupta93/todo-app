BUGS FOUND:
	1. The boundary of the window gets erased in parts when scrolling
through todo entries. FIX: Let us put in two curses windows. One which is just a
bounding box, and the other which has all the content ((STATUS: I think that the
two curses windows idea has been implemented but it hasn't helped much, the
boundary still vanishes))

	2. NAVIGATION ISSUES: First, fix all the different modes -- Visual/Insert/Edit. Noted errors:
		a. In the EDIT mode: Response on pressing 'l' is not consistent. On the first entry, nothing happens if you have reached the end. On the other entries, pressing 'l' at the end of the line proceeds to the next entry. On the last entry, this cause a segmentation fault.

	3. Adding a STATUS BAR similar to VIM. This BAR should display the current mode, and the last action key that was pressed.
	4. Add feature for SAVING TODO LISTS as plain text files (Or in a database?). An SQL database would be a much better idea.

TO BE ADDED SOMETIME:
	1. User accounts and multiple ToDo lists. A single ToDo list is not the ultimate goal of this application. Several features should be added, like support for multiple todo-lists (daily/weekly/monthly).
